Todo App

1. Once you've downloaded the files from Github, navigate to the folder through bash commands (`cd <name_of_directory>`)
2. At this directory location, create two terminal/powershell windows.
3. In one window, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. 
4. In the other, type and enter `cd client && npm install` and once the process finishes, type and enter `npm start`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 on your favorite broswer, and you should see the app there.
